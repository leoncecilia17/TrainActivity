# TrainActivity

Are you tired of calculating when your next train is coming? And how many minutes are remaining? Stop doing math. Use this app. 
 
This app will help you figure out what time the next train will arrive at and how many minutes are remaining based on the information you provide. The only thing you need to do is enter the train's name, destination, at what time the train makes its first run, and how often the train runs everyday (frequency in minutes). Your input will be added to the table at the top with two new pieces of information: next arrival and minutes away (the browser will calculate this information for you and add it to the table). Also, guess what? The information your enter will be saved, so you can rest assured that your information will be stored and ready to use on the page when you reload.  

Enjoy your new planning freedom with this app.
